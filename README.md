# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a simple console-based Number Guessing Game written in Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number within a limited number of attempts. Feedback is given for each guess (too high / too low / correct), and the game supports multiple rounds.
